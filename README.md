# BadBank Application
BadBank Application Capstone Project for MIT xPRO

### How to Run
1. Clone this repo and load it into your chosen system. 
2. Use npm install to install all dependencies.
3. Run using node index.js. 

### Description
This project was used as a basis for learning about full stack app creation. It started originally with only front end content and has moved into a three-tier app including back end coding and database usage. This app has no professional usage, hence the "BadBank" name, because it is just a learning tool. My one note is that this code did not work for me because I continued to run into an error from the firebase package.json file. I did try multiple ways to fix this error and also reached out to learning facilitators. However, I ultimately could not figure out the issue and was left with only code. 

### Technology Used
This application was written in Visual Studio Code. The design and CSS incorporated Bootstrap components. The database used was MongoDB and Firebase was used for Authentication. I would have deployed this app with Heroku if able. 

### Features
Going forward, I would like to take the time to fix whatever issues the firebase package was having. I'd like to add more authentication routes and page roles as well as other fun "bank" UI components.
