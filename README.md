# BadBank Application
BadBank Application Project for MITxPro Professional Certificate in Coding

### Description
This project was used as a basis for learning about full stack app creation. It started originally with only front end content and has moved into a three-tier app including back end coding and database usage. This app has no professional usage, hence the "BadBank" name, because it is just a learning tool. 

### Installation Guidelines
You can use git clone to use this application. Make sure you have downloaded npm and used npm init to download the node modules necessary for this application. You may also want to ensure that Express, MongoDB, and Docker are installed on you local computer.

### Technology Used
This application was written in Visual Studio Code. It is used with React and also has Bootstrap and Babel for CSS components. The database used was MongoDB. This was also created using NPM, Express, and Docker. 

### Features
Going forward, I will be attempting to add authentication to the app using Firebase. I'd also like to implement more UI elements such as alerting a user if an account has been created already with a certain email address. I'd also like to add my own color scheme and other fun elements.
